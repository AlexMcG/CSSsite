# Computer Science Society Website

This is the github repo for the Computer Science Society Website. I made this so we wont be overwriting eachothers
work when upload to the ftp. This should make it easy for us to collaborate.

I started us off by making a template that combines bootstrap and html5 boilerplate. This should take care of most of
the legwork for us. It will take care the browser specific issues and makes the site automatically mobile ready. Other
than that the site is blank.

Send me your github username on facebook or post it on the CSS group and I will add you as a collaborator to the repo.
Feel free to replace the template or make other destructive changes. Since the project is in source control we can
always revert if we want to recover something.

It's relatively quick and will teach you enough to be able to work on this project.
